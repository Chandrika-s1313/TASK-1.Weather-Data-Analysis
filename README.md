# TASK-1.Weather-Data-Analysis

Project Title: Weather Data Analysis (Entry Level)
Objective: Conduct basic data analytics and visualization on the Weather Data
Set to gain insights. No machine learning is required for this entry-level project,
and tools such as PowerBI, Tableau, or any preferred tool can be used for
analysis and visualization.

Tasks:
1. Descriptive Statistics:
- Compute and present basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for
MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall, and Evaporation.
2. Time Series Visualization:
- Create a line chart to show the variations in weather variables over time,
identifying trends or patterns.
3. Correlation Analysis:
- Calculate and visualize correlations between MinTemp, MaxTemp, Rainfall,
and Evaporation using a heatmap.
4. Rainfall Distribution:
- Illustrate the distribution of rainfall through a histogram or kernel density
plot, highlighting common levels and outliers.
5. Seasonal Analysis:
- Analyze average values of weather variables across different seasons and
visualize seasonal patterns with bar graphs.
